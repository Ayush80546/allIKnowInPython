1-create a file named .env at any location of our choice which is safe.
2-assign the value to a variable of the required name with = without any space
  --[MyProject]
    # My top-secret settings for MyProject
    MyUsername="Fred Bloggs"
    MyEmail="fred@example.com"
    MyPassword="fvghtyu7i890ol"
3-in project we can get it using python-dotenv package using "pip install python-dotenv"
  --import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv  # pip install python-dotenv 
    load_dotenv("E:/Python/EnvironmentVariables/.env")

    USER_NAME = os.getenv("MyUsername")
    API_KEY = os.getenv("MyAPIKey_MyOtherProject")
-environment variables are always strings so use type conversion for desired value.
-If you're worried about the security of the text file on your PC, then you could encrypt the file using something like AXCrypt.
